*Style together — designers, writers, developers, and everyone else — using a language you already know.*

**Versatile** is a natural language styling plugin for [Tilesheets](/modules/standalone/css-pipeline). It replaces standard selectors and property declarations with **natural language-based constructs**, in an attempt to make CSS more accessible and collaborative. Whether you’re a developer, a designer, or just curious, it helps **bridge the gap between human expression and visual design**.
